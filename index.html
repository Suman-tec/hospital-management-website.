         <p><em>"I was very pleased with my experience at Doctors Care. I can be a hard critic of emergency care places and the people employed by them. Combine that attitude with an innate crankiness when I’m not feeling at all well and the result can be much less than pleasant. This time (My first time at Doctors Care) was a world away from previous experiences elsewhere. It was good to be treated with professionalism and care. "</em></p>

The Doctor had been busy but still took the time to make me feel like I was the only patient there. The gentleman that took my initial information was terrific, he too made me feel like I was the first patient of the day. I loved visiting and if I need their service again I know I will be welcomed.”</em></p>

The TV Monitor with the DVD playing beautiful relaxing nature scenes was the best I have ever seen. [Doctors] are TRULY AMAZING, as well as the front desk staff were incredible on all 3 visits I made to your office. I love the fact that you bill for one visit and can return within 10 days to have a follow up or check it out again as part of the original payment. ”</em></p>
